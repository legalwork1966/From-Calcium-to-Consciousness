The origin of subjective experience remains unresolved within neuroscience and biophysics. Here, we examine the evolutionary progression from primitive cellular excitability to affective awareness, identifying calcium ions (Ca²⁺) as a conserved biophysical substrate linking sensation, motion, and internal state regulation.
